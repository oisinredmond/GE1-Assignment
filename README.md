# Project Description:
The aim of this project is to create an impressive and mesmerising visual experience through procedural generation 
of 3D visuals. The project uses Fast Fourier Transform to analyse audio signals visually represent different frequency bands through the use of a phyllotaxis spiral with lerping trail renderers.

# Audio Analyser:
The audio input will be interpreted and divided into componenet frequencies using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.
These component frequencies will then be used to create beautiful graphical effects.
