# GE1-Assignment
Game Engines 1 Assignment - Procederal visuals in Unity 3D based on audio input

# Project Description:
The aim of this project is to create an impressive and mesmerising visual experience through procedural generation 
of 3D visuals. The project will use audio input, such as a song or a series of sounds that will be intpreted and translated
into various 3D game objects and effects in the Unity game engine. I hope to create abstract and colorful graphics that
react in real time to music and sound.

The audio input will be interpreted and divided into componenet frequencies using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.
These component frequencies will then be used to create beautiful graphical effects. Given enough time I would also like
to enable the ability to interpret and visualise audio from a midi input, from electronic instruments such as drums or
keyboard. This would visualise the music you are playing in real time for the user.

# Potential Technologies to be Used:
- Unity Game Engine
- Fast Fourier Transform algorithm
- Various Newtonian physics formulas/principles
- Midi interface w/ elctronic instruments
